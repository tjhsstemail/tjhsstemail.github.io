Dear Principal Ann Bonitatibus, Director of TJ Admissions Jeremy Shughart, and FCPS School Board Members,<br><br>

My name is <b>[YOUR NAME]</b> and I graduated from TJ in <b>[YEAR]</b>.<br><br>

For too long, TJ's admissions process has systematically excluded Black and Latinx students from TJ's student body. Fairfax County's student population is 9.8% Black and 26.8% Latinx. TJ's student body is 1.9% Black and 2.4% Latinx. These racial disparities were all too real during our time as students, and have only grown over time. This year, the incoming first-year class will have so few Black students that the number cannot even be officially reported.<br><br>

These disparities are a moral failing. They deny Black and Latinx students the myriad resources, opportunities, and advantages provided to TJ students. They deprive the TJ community--and STEM fields across America--of the talents, insights, and experiences of Black and Latinx scholars. Instead of countering systemic racism in society and STEM, TJ exacerbates it.<br><br>

I am emailing today to demand that TJ immediately adopt an antiracist admissions process that achieves proportional representation of Black and Latinx students. In a class of 450, that would mean at least 36 Black students and 97 Latinx students to be within 20% of Fairfax County's demographics.<br><br>

I also demand that TJ introduce a concrete and transparent plan to ensure that the school's learning environment is one in which Black and Latinx students can thrive. This will require changes beyond the admissions process, including careful attention to the inclusiveness of the school culture and curriculum, the diversity of the faculty and staff, and commitment to antiracist educational practices that actively support the development of young Black and Latinx scientists.<br><br>

I am committing to withhold all support to the school until these demands are met. I will not donate to the school or TJ Partnership Fund. I will close off my alumni connections to the school and its students. <b>[IF YOU CAN PERSONALLY OFFER ANY OTHER ACTIONS, ADD HERE, E.G., DISCOURAGING YOUR COMPANY FROM OFFERING INTERNSHIPS TO TJ STUDENTS; STOP PARTICIPATING IN SPECIFIC NETWORKING EVENTS LIKE tjSTAR; REFUSING TO SEND YOUR CHILDREN TO TJ IF YOU ARE IN NOVA.]</b> I will be loud about TJ's racist admissions outcomes until TJ's demographics and learning environment are ones I can be proud of.<br><br>

This is a joint commitment with other TJ alumni. Please expect a letter further detailing our position soon.<br><br>

Thank you,<br>
